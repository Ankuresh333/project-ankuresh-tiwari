BUILD OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
========================

Project Category

The proposed project falls under Web Application category in which sets of technologies are used. 
Internet Technology JAVA is a powerful and flexible server-side technology for creating dynamic web pages. 
JAVA is only one of a set of technologies that comprise the all web server.
 It helps to create faster, more reliable, dynamic web pages with any of the programming languages supported byJAVA .
JAVA allows using a far greater selection of full programming languages and fully utilizing the rich potential of the web server tools.

Tools and Platform used

Platform/Environment used		: 	Microsoft Windows 10
Web Server				:	Apache Tomcat 8.0			
Integrated Development Environment	Net Beans 8.1
Browser				:	MS Internet Explorer 
Front End			: 	HTML, Dhtml, javascript
Database Server   			:	 oracle  
Hardware Requirement

Intel Pentium class processor 800 MHz or higher
Minimum 1GB RAM 
Hard disk space require 40 GB
Video 800x256, 256 colors

When you build an Java application project that has a main class, the IDE
automatically copies all of the JAR
files on the projects classpath to your projects dist/lib folder. The IDE
also adds each of the JAR files to the Class-Path element in the application
JAR files manifest file (MANIFEST.MF).

To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and
type the following:

java -jar "LoginApp.jar" 

To distribute this project, zip up the dist folder (including the lib folder)
and distribute the ZIP file.

Notes:

* If two JAR files on the project classpath have the same name, only the first
JAR file is copied to the lib folder.
* Only JAR files are copied to the lib folder.
If the classpath contains other types of files or folders, these files (folders)
are not copied.
* If a library on the projects classpath also has a Class-Path element
specified in the manifest,the content of the Class-Path element has to be on
the projects runtime path.
* To set a main class in a standard Java project, right-click the project node
in the Projects window and choose Properties. Then click Run and enter the
class name in the Main Class field. Alternatively, you can manually type the
class name in the manifest Main-Class element.


Components of Java Server Pages
Java Server Pages are composed of standard HTML tags and JSP tags. The
available JSP tags defined in the JSP 1.0 specification are categorized as
follows:
❑	Directives
❑	Declarations
❑	Script lets
❑	Comments
❑	Expressions. This section describes each of these categories in more detail. 
 
Risk Analysis
	
Uncertainty, which is constantly present in our daily lives, frequently impacts our decisions and actions.  When we talk about risk, we normally mean the chance that some undesirable impact will occur.  Hence, we normally seek to avoid or minimize risk.  If there is a chance of rain, and we don't want to get wet, we may choose to stay indoors -- avoiding that risk -- or we may take an umbrella to minimize the impact of rain upon us. Uncertainty can impact our decisions and actions in desirable as well as undesirable ways.   In risk analysis we usually focus on what can go wrong -- the outcomes that represent loss or damage -- although an effective analysis will also help us understand what can go right as well.

	A risk assessment involves evaluating existing physical and environmental security and controls, and assessing their adequacy relative to the potential threats of the organization. A business impact analysis involves identifying the critical business functions within the organization and determining the impact of not performing the business function beyond the maximum acceptable outage. Types of criteria that can be used to evaluate the impact include: customer service, internal operations, legal/statutory and financial.
Our business processes depend heavily on technology and automated systems, and their disruption for even a few days could cause severe financial loss and threaten survival. The continued operations of this organization depend on management’s awareness of potential disasters, their ability to develop a plan to minimize disruptions of mission critical functions, and the capability to recover operations expediently and successfully. The risk analysis process provides the foundation for the entire recovery planning effort.
A primary objective of business recovery planning is to protect the organization in the event that all or part of its operations and/or computer services is rendered unusable. Each functional area of the organization should be analyzed to determine the potential risk and impact related to various disaster threats.
Regardless of the prevention techniques employed, possible threats that could arise inside or outside the organization need to be assessed. Although the exact nature of potential disasters or their resulting consequences are difficult to determine, it is beneficial to perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all threats that can realistically occur to the organization. Regardless of the type of threat, the goals of business recovery planning are to ensure the safety of customers, employees and other personnel during and following a disaster.

Uncertainty can arise in several ways:

	If the quantity we'd like to know is a competing firm's planned product price, uncertainty arises from our lack of knowledge:  The price may be well known to that firm's employees, but it's unknown to us. 
	If the quantity is market demand for products like ours, uncertainty arises from the complexity of the process:  Demand depends on economic factors, fashions and preferences, and our and other firms' actions -- and even if we knew all of these, we couldn't fully calculate their net impact on final demand. 
	If the quantity is a material thickness in nanometers, uncertainty may arise from limits on our ability to measure this physical quantity.  We may also have limits on our ability to control fabrication of the material. 
	Many processes that we want to model -- from the failure rate of an electronic component to the behavior of a macromolecule -- have inherent randomness for all intents and purposes.
